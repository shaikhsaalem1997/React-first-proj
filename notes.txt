# Adding inline style in JSX:
We usually write margin-top or margin-bottom (with hyphen)
But in JSX we use amelCase: marginTop with {{}}


# State in Class component:
if we want to update the state then use setState

if we want to pass data from Parent to child : use props
and for child to Parent we can use function as a props

# React Hooks:
{useState, useEffect}

useEffect:
whenever the value changes, it helps us to render the conponent again.
