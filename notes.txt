# To create React App:

- npx create-react-app contact-app

Syntax:
- npx create-react-app (App name)

- cd contact-app

#### After npm install uuidv4 >> npm install util ######

# JSX (javascript XML) - Combination for javascript and HTML

class as innerhtml -> is called as className in JSX

# For Semantic UI

# Link:
https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage/#css

npm install --save semantic-ui-react
npm install --save semantic-ui-css

- Then Import it in Component:
import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';

PROPS: Pass data from parents to child
- passing data as property (varibale in component)


# Adding inline style in JSX:
We usually write margin-top or margin-bottom (with hyphen)
But in JSX we use amelCase: marginTop with {{}}


# State in Class component:
if we want to update the state then use setState

if we want to pass data from Parent to child : use props
and for child to Parent we can use function as a props

# React Hooks:
{useState, useEffect}

useEffect:
whenever the value changes, it helps us to render the conponent again.

# ROUTING
npm install react-router-dom --save

# NOTE:
We add "{}" in Import section only bcoz if is not a default export component
Eg: 
import {link} from 'react-router-dom' >> Link is not default export
import ContactList from './ContactList' >> ContactList is default export (written at end)
